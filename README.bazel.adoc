= async-uri (Bazelized)


== OPAM deps

See the `depends` clause in link:async_ssl.opam[async_ssl.opam].

We do not need `conf-libssl`, `dune`, or `dune-configurator`, but it
does not hurt if they are installed.

Make sure you have installed the correct versions.

Then:

    bazel run @obazl//coswitch/<SCOPE>:refresh

where <SCOPE> is `local` if you installed your switch locally,
otherwise `sys` or `xdg`.
